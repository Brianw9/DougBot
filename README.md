# DougBot
Dougbot is a discord bot originally designed to play audio clips on command. Since its first iteration I've expanded Dougbot to have more useful commands, like getting quick info from DuckDuckGo's search API, a weighted team balancer, and adding custom sound commands to a database.


# What I learned

This project was my first introduction to Javascript and Node.js. Along with learning about a new programming language, this project exposed me to using a RESTful API with MongoDB, learning about sorting algorithms, and more extensive use of GitHub.
